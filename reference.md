**Array** - Items (such as objects, numbers, etc.) arranged in rows and/or columns. In computer science, an **array data structure**, or simply an **array**, is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (**values** or **variables**), each identified by at least one array index or **key**

**Cell** - A **code cell** allows you to write and edit code, with syntax highlighting and tab completion, and can then execute that code, or make it run - see [Code cells](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html#:~:text=collection%20of%20examples.-,Code%20cells,(IPython)%20runs%20Python%20code.)

**Code** - the set of instructions in a computer program. **Coding** is the process of using a computer language to create a program.

**Command** - In computing, a [command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_(computing)#:~:text=In%20computing%2C%20a%20command%20is,an%20option%20in%20a%20menu.) is a specific order to a computer program to perform a specific task.

**Command line** -  is a user interface that is navigated by typing **commands** at prompts, instead of using the mouse. A [**command-line interface**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface#Command-line_interpreter) processes commands to a computer program in the form of lines of text.

**Computational notebook** - A **notebook interface** (also called a **computational notebook**) is a virtual notebook environment used for literate programming.

**Computational output** - This is the result of running code - in a notebook interface it could be a visualisation, a calculation, a map, a chart, any kind of result of the first **input** process.

**Documentation** - This is the information that describes the software, code or any process related to the process of programming.

**Kernel** -  a computer program at the core of a computer's operating system with complete control over everything in the system - see [Kernel_(operating_system)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system))

**Key** - In programming, a key is a piece of information required to retrieve some data. Keys are defined to help speed up access to data - a unique identifier for the complete data used to retrieve it from some location in the structure.

**Literate programming** - pairs the functionality of word processing software with the concept of a code cell that contains and executes code.

**Markdown** - a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is how you can make rich (or formatted) text in a plain text editor.

**Open-source** - openly available and accessible, free to use and community based in regard to support and updates.

**Programming** - The process of creating a set of instructions that defines what a computer is to do to accomplish a computing result.

**Rich text** - text that includes formatting commands for page layout such as fonts, bold, underline, italics, bullet points, numbering and tables.

**Value** - In computing, values are used to perform calculations and store data. It is the content of a field or a variable, can be alphabetical or numerical.

**Variable** - In programming, a variable is a container that holds information that can be used for calculations and data analysis. Think of it as a box that you can put something (ie a value) in. A variable always has a name and contains a value.

**Vector** - A **vector**, in programming, is a type of array that is one dimensional. **Vectors** are a logical element in programming languages that are used for storing data.
