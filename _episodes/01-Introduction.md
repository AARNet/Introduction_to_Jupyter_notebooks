### Introduction

Computational notebooks have been around since the late 1980s.
Essentially a notebook is an advanced word processor.
Also known as a notebook interface, the concept is that it is a virtual notebook environment used
for literate programming.
'Literate programming' pairs the functionality of word processing software with both the shell and
kernel of that notebook's programming language.

Notebooks are documents that contain both code and rich text elements,
such as links, equations and different ways of visualising data via
graphs, tables and figures. Because of the mix of code and text,
notebooks are an ideal place to bring together results and an analysis
description. Notebooks are really smart documents - they can perform
data analysis in real time.

## Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter is named after three computer programming languages - **Ju**lia, **Pyt**hon and **R**.
 It is a free, open-source, interactive web tool  which researchers use so they can combine software code,
 computational output, explanatory text and multimedia resources in a single document.

Jupyter Notebooks also refer to Galileo’s original notebooks of his observations of celestial bodies.
These have all been digitized now and are really beautiful historical objects.
Here are the notes he made on his discovery of Jupiter’s moons:

You can see in this image the title, comments, documentation, equations and diagrams.
That’s what Jupyter Notebooks are designed to do, with the added bonus of the computer performing the
 calculations and creating the visualisations on your behalf. A beautiful 21st century object instead.

Jupyter Notebooks have exploded in popularity over the past couple of years, now supporting additional
 languages and being used by more and more people from different disciplines.

> ## Activity - Jargon busting
>
> In pairs, talk about the language used in the introductions. Are you familiar with these terms?
What are the words that trip you up? Think of a way to remember what that word means in this context that might
 help others understand it better. How could you re-write some of the introductory text above to make it
 easier to understand?
>
> Add your definitions to some of the terms we'll be using in today's workshop Etherpad, and remember to keep
 adding them as we go. This will be a useful resource for us all later!
