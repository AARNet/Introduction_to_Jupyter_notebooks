# Finishing your session

When you start a session in SWAN you are using an allocation of a cloud computer. One of the advantages of SWAN is that you can use the higher power of the AARNet cloud, rather than taking up memory on your own desktop or laptop. This means you can run your programming or analysis separately, in the background. It also means that when you are finished with your analysis, it is important to shutdown your session, rather than simply close the browser.

## How can I see what I have running in my session?

Once you have a running session, you can check at any time which Notebook files are active by clicking the Running icon on the left-hand side of the interface.

To shutdown an active notebook, click **SHUT DOWN** next to the item you wish to shutdown.

## Do I have to shutdown my session when I am not using it?

We recommend you save and shutdown your Notebook if you are not using it.

The way to finish your session is to click on the file menu then select ‘Shutdown Current Session’.

So that the SWAN experience is fair to all users, if you leave your Notebook idle it will automatically be stopped after **five** days.

If you are running programs and analyses that are running for days, we recommend you contact us to discuss the processes you wish to undertake.
