# Jupyter Notebooks in the researcher's toolkit

A  2017 survey by Kaggle of 16,000 data professionals included this question for data professionals:

“For work, which data science/analytics tools, technologies, and languages have you used in the past year? (Select all that apply).”

The answers were:

- Python 60%
- R 46%
- Jupyter Notebooks 32%

## Reasons for using Jupyter Notebooks:

- Designed to make data analysis easier to share and reproduce
- Used increasingly by researchers who want to keep detailed records of their work - reproducibility
- Can devise teaching modules and collaborate with colleagues
- Researchers are publishing the notebooks to back up their research papers
- Jupyter Notebooks are used as a new form of interactive research publishing

### Jupyter Notebooks for exploring data

- [OzGLAM Data Workbench](https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/ozglam-workbench)
- [Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/)
- [Cervantes Virtual](http://data.cervantesvirtual.com/blog/notebooks/)

### Jupyter Notebooks for teaching    

- [Teaching and Learning with Jupyter](https://jupyter4edu.github.io/jupyter-edu-book/)
- [Code as Literacy](https://code.research.uts.edu.au/143852/code-as-literacy-jupyter-notebooks/-/tree/master/understanding-python)

## Using Jupyter Notebooks in the cloud

One of the benefits of using Jupyter Notebooks is that you can run them in the cloud, without having to use anything other than your browser. In addition to AARNet's SWAN (built in collaboration with CERN with researchers in mind), there are several services you can use to run your notebook in the cloud.

### Services available

- [CloudStor SWAN](https://support.aarnet.edu.au/hc/en-us/articles/360000575395-What-is-CloudStor-SWAN-) (via AARNet)
- [Binder](https://mybinder.org/)
- [Kaggle Kernels](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels)
- [Google Colaboratory (Colab)](https://colab.research.google.com)
- [Microsoft Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com)
- [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/doc/jupyter-notebook.html)
- [Datalore](https://datalore.io/)

### Benefits across all services

- No need to install anything on your local machine
- Free (or free plan)
- Access to Jupyter Notebook environment (or Jupyter-like environment)
- Ability to import and export notebooks using the standard .ipynb file format
- They support Python language (and most support other languages)

### How to choose the right Jupyter Notebooks environment for you

- Take a look at [this table of comparisons](https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/LAYCLWFGCZNgCEu)

There are many options. Think about how you work, whether desktop or cloud is more useful or reliable.

- Is there data available in an integrated environment, so you can work directly with the data, without having to download large datasets? Try your cloud service.
- Do you work in the field, away from the network, for example? A desktop might be better for you, try [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python) (desktop app).

>
>- Read ['Why Jupyter is data scientists’ computational notebook of choice'](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07196-1#:~:text=Jupyter%20is%20a%20free%2C%20open,resources%20in%20a%20single%20document.)
>- Discuss in pairs the benefits and any drawbacks of using Jupyter Notebooks in research.
>- Can you imagine how Jupyter Notebooks might be used in your field? Look up some examples both in research and teaching or research communication.
