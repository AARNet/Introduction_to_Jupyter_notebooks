## Getting started in CloudStor

Follow these step-by-step instructions to get started with Jupyter Notebooks in CloudStor:

### LOG IN TO CLOUDSTOR

1. Go to the AARNet website: https://www.aarnet.edu.au/
2. Click on 'Log In and Tools' in the top righthand corner of the page.
3. Select 'CloudStor'.
4. Choose your organisation and click on 'Login at AARNet'.
5. Sign-in with your credentials - user name and password - and click 'Login'.

You are now in CloudStor, which is a cloud storage environment.

### CREATE A NOTEBOOK

1. At the top of the page there is a black banner that shows several icons. Double-click on the swan.
2. From the 'Wecome to SWAN' (service for web-based analysis), click on 'Go to my Notebooks'.
3. You will notice here that you can see 'Spawning new notebook' come up on the screen. This means that a notebook is being created. This can take a minute or so.
4. When the next screen comes up you will see a menu for files. On the right hand side there is a button called 'New', with a triangle next to it. If you click on this you will see a dropdown menu.
5. Underneath the heading 'Notebook' you will see a list of computer languages. Click on on 'R'.
6. Select 'File' at the top left hand side of the screen and select 'Save As'. Name your notebook 'Intro to Jupyter Notebooks'.

If you don't have access to CloudStor, follow these instructions:

Open up [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org/)

Paste GitHub Repo: https://github.com/ingridbmason/Intro-to-Jupyter/

Open your new notebook, select Python 3 and save. (The free version of MyBinder does not support R - please be patient while we do that bit).

There are many different ways you can access Jupyter Notebooks, such as MyBinder.org or via Anaconda - we will talk about these options at the end of the workshop.

#### Activity

Take a good look around the dashboard. You can see there is a menu bar showing some titles that might be recognisable, like the 'File' menu we used before.

Click on each of these to see what is in the menu. Make sure you click on the 'Help' function to see what kind of options there are when you hit a problem.

Underneath the menu bar there are some buttons that you can use to perform certain tasks, such as saving your notebook, adding a cell, deleting a cell, running a code cell and so on. Hover your mouse over each of these to see what these buttons do.
