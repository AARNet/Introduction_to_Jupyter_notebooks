## Getting started in CloudStor

Follow these step-by-step instructions to get started with Jupyter Notebooks in CloudStor:

### Log in to CloudStor

1. Go to the AARNet website: https://www.aarnet.edu.au/
2. Click on 'Log In and Tools' in the top righthand corner of the page.
3. Select 'CloudStor'.
4. Choose your organisation and click on 'Login at AARNet'.
5. Sign-in with your credentials - user name and password - and click 'Login'.

You are now in CloudStor, which is a cloud storage environment.

### Create a notebook

1. At the top of the page there is a black banner that shows several icons. Double-click on the swan.
2. From the 'Welcome to SWAN' (Service for Web-based Analysis) pop-up, click on 'Start My Notebook Session'.
3. You will notice here that you can see 'Starting your session' come up on the screen. This means that a notebook is being created. This can take a minute or so as SWAN creates a computing environment for you in the cloud.
4. When the next screen comes up you will see a menu for files on the right hand side and a launcher on the left.
5. Underneath the heading 'Notebook' you will see a list of programming languages. Click on 'R'. Your untitled notebook will open in place of the launcher
6. Select 'File' at the top left hand side of the screen and select 'Save Notebook As'. Name your notebook 'Intro to Jupyter Notebooks', ensuring to keep the **.ipynb** file extension in the name, eg 'Intro to Jupyter Notebooks.ipynb'.

If you don't have access to CloudStor, follow these instructions:

1. Open up [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org/)
2. Paste GitHub Repo: [LINK TO NOTEBOOK IN AARNET GITHUB]
3. Open your new notebook, select Python 3 and save. (The free version of MyBinder does not support R - please be patient while we do that bit).

There are many different ways you can access Jupyter Notebooks, such as MyBinder.org or via Anaconda - we will talk about these options at the end of the workshop.

> ## Activity
>
> Take a good look around the dashboard. You can see there is a menu bar showing some titles that might be recognisable, like the 'File' menu we used before.
>
> Click on each of these to see what is in the menu. Make sure you click on the 'Help' function to see what kind of options there are when you hit a problem.
>
> Underneath the menu bar there are some buttons that you can use to perform certain tasks, such as saving your notebook, adding a cell, deleting a cell, running a code cell and so on. Hover your mouse over each of these to see what these buttons do.
