# What can Jupyter Notebooks do?

Jupyter Notebooks offer a hybrid environment in which you can perform computational tasks while also using text to annotate or describe what you and your code blocks are doing. It's a like a mix between the command line and a word processor.


> “The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and much more.”

## What you can do in Jupyter Notebooks?

#### Data cleaning

[Data cleaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_cleansing) is about finding and correcting (or removing) inaccuracies from a dataset, a table, or a database. The process involves identifying incomplete, incorrect, inaccurate or irrelevant parts of the data and then replacing, modifying, or deleting them.

In Jupyter Notebooks you can preview and analyse a limited number of columns and rows of data at a time, so you can see if there are blanks or repeated errors or inaccuracies. In addition, working directly with a large dataset without having to download it can save a lot of time.

#### Data transformation

[Data transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation) is the process of converting data values from one source format or structure to another so they become consistent or intelligible to a target structure or system. A typical scenario where information needs to be shared involves the extraction of the data from the source application or data custodian, the transformation of that data into another format, and finally loading the transformed data into the target location.

#### Numerical simulation

[Numerical simulation](https://www.nature.com/subjects/numerical-simulations#:~:text=A%20numerical%20simulation%20is%20a,as%20in%20most%20nonlinear%20systems.) is when you use maths to create models, essentially computer programs that are designed to simulate what might or what did happen in a situation.  By using numerical analysis you can approximate the real solution of the problem.

#### Statistical modeling

A statistical model can be thought of as a statistical assumption (or set of statistical assumptions) with a certain property: that the assumption allows us to calculate the probability of any event. Purposes of statistical models can be for prediction, estimation or description.

#### Visualisation

One of the really powerful attributes of Jupyter Notebooks is that of visualisation. In notebooks you can create graphs, tables, plots, heatmaps, charts, mathematical equations and so on. These tools are very helpful for exploration as well as demonstration.

## A word on languages (tee hee)

Jupyter Notebooks can be used with a variety of different programming languages. Initially they were for Julia, Python and R but now they support many more.

### Python and R

At the moment the two most popular programming tools for data science work are Python and R. While Python is often praised for being a general-purpose language with an easy-to-understand syntax, R's functionality is developed with statisticians in mind. It is said that Python is simple and easy to understand and learn, but Python doesn’t have specialized packages for statistical computing, unlike R.

If you don't know any languages, it might be helpful to think about the types of tasks you want to perform. Python is currently the most popular language used in Jupyter Notebooks but you should also consider what is commonly used in your field.

> ## Activity - R versus Python
>
> 1. In pairs, talk about which programming language might make the most sense for you and why.
>
> 2. Take a look at [this poster](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/r-or-python-for-data-analysis) if you don't know where to start.
>
> When you are ready, think about how you would recommend Python or R to someone else in your field. Share this with the group.
